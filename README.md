# Blazor Micro-Frontends Starter Template

Welcome to the **Blazor Micro-Frontends Starter Template**! üéâ

This template serves as a foundational starting point for building modular web applications using the Blazor framework combined with the Piral framework. With this setup, you'll be able to create a robust app shell and integrate micro-frontends seamlessly.

## ‚ú® Features
- **App Shell:** A central Blazor application that acts as the container for your micro-frontends (pilets).
- **Micro-Frontends (Pilets):** Independent Blazor components that can be developed, deployed, and maintained separately, allowing for greater modularity and scalability.
- **Run-Time Composition:** The application dynamically loads and integrates micro-frontends at runtime, providing flexibility in updating and managing individual components without the need to redeploy the entire application.

## üìÇ Clone the repository
